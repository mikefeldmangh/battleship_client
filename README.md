This is my attempt at a Battleship client. It is not complete and has not been tested. It does not yet work with the Battleship server. A lot more could be done to DRY out the code once I understand more about Ruby iterators.

I was not sure how to incorporate my code with the server and to make the AJAX requests.
Also I haven't gotten to processing the sunken ship response. I still need to go through the current hit list and find exactly where the sunken ship is based on the length but I just have not had time.
